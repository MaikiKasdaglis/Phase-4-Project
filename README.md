Here's an outline of the app and its tables:

Tables: a. Users: Store user information such as username, email, password, etc. b. Dogs: Store details about dogs such as name, breed, age, description, etc. c. Photos: Store information about the dog photos, including the file path, title, description, date taken, etc. d. Dog_Photos (Join table): This table will establish a many-to-many relationship between dogs and photos. It will have foreign keys pointing to the Dogs table (dog_id) and Photos table (photo_id).

Functionality: a. User Authentication: Allow users to register, log in, and log out. b. Dog Management: Users can add, edit, and delete dog profiles, including details like breed, age, and description. c. Photo Upload: Users can upload and manage dog photos, including adding a title, description, and date taken for each photo. d. Association: Users can associate photos with dogs, creating a many-to-many relationship between them. This allows multiple photos to be associated with one dog, and vice versa. e. Dog Photography Portfolio: Display the dog photos in a gallery or portfolio format, allowing users to view and appreciate the dog photography. f. Filtering and Sorting: Implement filtering and sorting options to allow users to search for specific dogs or browse photos based on criteria like breed, age, or date taken.
